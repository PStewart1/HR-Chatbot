# HR-Chatbot
Intro-------|

HR chatbot is a HR resource tool enabled by an LLM (Large Language Model) to emulate human responses both accurately and anonymously, all interacted with through a cloud-hosted frontend applet.

The chatbot is designed to create a seamless experience for both the end user and manager by addressing common issues, concerns, or points of inquiry.

This project is part of our school's Capstone program, intended for students to collaborate on an MVP to pitch/showcase as part of their portfolio both to employers and investors.
